# DL-work

first run the complete_covid_system_with_comparison.py file it will give you 2 .pth file one is for the Custon CNN and another is for the ResNet50 
It will give you 1)best_custom_model.pth and 2)best_resnet_model.pth these are the pre trained model 
If you want the Custom CNN for the model prediction then use covid_prediction_system.py file 
And if you want ResNet50 for the model prediction then use covid_resnet_predictor.py file 
And also import the dataset from kaggle
